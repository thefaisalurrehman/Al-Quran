## Using Quran for Android code in other projects

The intention behind open-sourcing Quran for Android is two fold - first, to allow developers to help contribute to the app, thus speeding up the development of new features and ideas. Second, to give back to the community and serve as a code reference.


Please keep use of this code for non-profit purposes only. Also, please note that the project is under the GPL 3 license, which requires that modifications to this code be open sourced as well. Please note that the data is licensed under the various licenses of the data's authors (typically, this is [CC BY-NC-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/), but may differ depending on the source of the data).
